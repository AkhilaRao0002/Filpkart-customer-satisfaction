This project focused on estimating the factors that influence customer satisfaction and finding strategies to enhance overall experience. Using a dataset of customer interactions, which contains information about the details of the purchase and isuues related to those products and the effeciency in solving them. This data is analysed using various chart for better understanding of the corelations among variables through visual representations. The data is then preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, and important features are extracted. It is then standardized to ensure consistent scaling, making it easier for the machine learning models to process and learn from the data effectively.

Three tree-based models were implemented: Random Forest Regressor, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. These models were chosen for their ability to handle both numeric and categorical features, capture non-linear relationships, and provide feature importance for actionable insights. To improve model performance, Bayesian Optimization (BayesSearchCV) was applied for hyperparameter tuning. This approach efficiently explores the hyperparameter space, learning from previous evaluations to find optimal parameters, resulting in higher accuracy and better generalization.

Models were evaluated using RMSE and R² Score, which measure prediction error and variance explained, respectively. Additionally, CSAT scores were categorized into Low, Medium, and High, enabling proactive identification of dissatisfied customers. Factors like issue resolution time, product quality, and support responsiveness emerged as the most influential, guiding businesses on where to focus improvements. By understanding the key drivers of customer satisfaction, businesses can make data-driven decisions to enhance service quality, optimize operations, and improve retention. This approach demonstrates the strategic value of machine learning in improving customer experience and driving positive business outcomes.
